# Particle-Tracking-using-Matlab
MATLAB code for analyzing colloidal particles captured with video microscopy. Matlab functions are based on IDL code written by David Grier (NYU), John Crocker (UPenn), and Eric Weeks (Emory) as well as Matlab Code written by Daniel Blair (Georgetown) and Eric Dufresne (Cornell).  

## Tutorial_ParticleTracking.mlx
Tutorial_ParticleTracking.mlx (a Matlab live script) shows to use the particle tracking functions. (Don't have Matlab ... a PDF of the output of the live script is included as well.) In short, the collection of particle tracking functions turns a video of particles moving around into an array of particles tracks in which the particles are tracked over time with sub-pixel x and y resolution.  

See more information in the live script: Tutorial_ParticleTracking.mlx.
