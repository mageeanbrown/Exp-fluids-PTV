# Particle-Tracking-using-Matlab
MATLAB code for analyzing colloidal particles captured with video microscopy. Matlab functions are based on IDL code written by David Grier (NYU), John Crocker (UPenn), and Eric Weeks (Emory). 

## Tutorial_ParticleTracking.mlx
The Live Script Tutorial_ParticleTracking.mlx shows how to use the functions used in particle tracking.  It turns a video of particles moving around:
